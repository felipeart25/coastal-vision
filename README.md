# coastal-vision
This is a space dedicated to explore new techniques, models, and aplications to make face to the climate change in the coastal zone

Hello, world! ðŸŒŠ

I'm a coastal engineer passionate about developing innovative tools and models to protect our coastlines and ecosystems. I believe in the power of AI and technology to revolutionize environmental engineering and make a positive impact on our planet.

Currently exploring the intersection of machine learning and coastal adaptation, with a focus on projects like the Sand Engine in the Netherlands.

Let's connect and collaborate to use technology for a sustainable future!
